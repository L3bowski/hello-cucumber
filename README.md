##Hello cucumber

This repository is a simple example of how to use cucumber to describe the expected behavior of the developed software, along with a VSCode plugin that offers sentences auto completion.

Install the necessary dependencies as per usual:

```
npm install
```

Run the cucumber tests through the test npm script:

```
npm test
```

To get the auto completion when writing new features, install the [Cucumber VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) and just start typing in any feature file!
